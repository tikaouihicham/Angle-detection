This project presents a vision-based algorithm designed to automatically detect and measure angles in industrial environments using Python. The approach integrates computer vision techniques with geometric analysis, enabling robust angle detection for tasks such as quality inspection, part alignment, and mechanical assembly verification.

The algorithm can be deployed in smart factories, industrial automation pipelines, and quality control systems, providing a reliable non-contact method for angle measurement.
